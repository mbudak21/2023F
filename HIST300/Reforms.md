## Selim III 1789-1808

- Idealological Influence of the French Revolution.

**Nizam-i cedid (Yeni Düzen):** The name of the reform movement during Selim III, also the name of the new military that was established. The new military was established parallel to Janniseries, it had more dispicline and was based on the French army. Janniseries and Ulema had great distaste for the newly formed army and because of the reactions Selim III abolished the army, but this was too little too late since Janniseries continued to rebel, Kabakçı Mustafa started the rebel using the justifications from Ulema. Selim was overthrown. And janniseries put a new pasha **Mustafa IIII**

**Alemdar Mustafa Pasha:** Also referred as Bayraktar Mustafa Pasha was not happy with these movements since he supported the reforms of Selim III. He was an Ayan from Bulgaria, Rusçuk. He took his army and marched to the capital, overthrowing the puppet sultan **Mustafa IIII**, and putting **Mahmud II** instead. **Mahmud II** made **Alemdar Mustafa Pasha** his vezir.

## Mahmud II, Second Founder (1808-1839)

**Sened-i Ittifak (Deed of Agreement):** **Mahmud II** and his grand vezir **Alemdar Mustafa Pasha** invited the local notables and signed an agreement with them, basically defining the responsibilities and the domain of each group. 5 weeks after the signage of the document **Alemdar Mustafa Pasha** was killed. 
**Imporant:** First time in the ottoman history the power of sultan was deemed not obsolete, since the sultan shared power with the other 5 people who signed the agreement.


1810 and 1820: Mahmud II eliminated the influence of Ayan's.
**Vaka-i Hayriye 1826:** Mahmud II got ulema on his side and completed the unfinished business of eliminating the Janniserries. The attack was made in İstanbul and Janniseries were brutally destroyed, around 8000 people.
