1960 Military Coup (May 27, 1960)

-DP did a lot of thing that violated the democratic order of Turkey. Especially the "investigatory committee" (tahkikat komisyonu) created exactly one month before the coup was alarming. They were basically appointed by the DP and were investigating claims. They were investigating the claims that RPP and other political parties were conspiring against DP. So, they said that they were going to investigate and punish that kind of activities. So they suspended all kinds of activities in the parliament. This happened in April 1960.

-On the other hand Menderes was still incredibly popular.

-Alparslan Türkeş declared the coup on the radio. There was an interesting sentence at the end of the statement read by Türkeş: The statement mentioned that Turkey is going to honor its commitment to NATO anda SANTO. This was a message to the outside world that coup-makers were not going to take away Turkey from the current alliances, and there will be a continuity in the international relationships.

-In the case of the coup in 1960, we do not see a direct involvement of the US. In the cases of 1971 and 1980, those connections with the US are more straightforward.

-The coup-makers carried out the coup outside the chain of command. The members of the top brass were very loyal to Menderes. 

-As the coup was not carried out under a chain of command, there were some conflicts within the military. So they wanted to determine the head of the new order to end the chaotic environment within the military.
->Cemal Gürsel was the former chief of land forces and was about to go into retirement. He was a respected and fatherly figure. So the coup-makers wanted to see Cemal Gürsel as the head of the NUC. By the way, Cemal Gürsel did not play a role in the preparation process of the military coup.


NUC (National Unity Committee), headed by Cemal Gürsel, was formed by the coup-makers. The members of National Unity Committee were relatively low-ranking military officers. Cemal Gürsel was announced the head of state, prime minister and minister of defense. For the next 16-17 months, we see a military-government making all the decisions. 



-There were factions emerging inside the NUC.

-Urban population was excited and generally happy about what happened, but the rest of the country, the overwhelming majority that lived in countryside, were not very happy.

-We see some purges in the summer months following the coup. First 235 generals were forced to retire and leave the army so that people coming from below could rise up to their positions. Some argue that this was because those old generals were not compatible with NATO's new security architecture. However, back then the state had no money to pay their severance package. The widespread rumor is that the Americans provided that money so that those people could retire. Another significant purges were in universities. 149 academics were kicked out of their positions. To protest this decision, all the rectors resigned. 

-In the meanwhile, we see the rise of Alparslan Türkeş. He was a hardliner, and he had no faith in civilians. He thought that NUC should stay in power as long as it takes. Cemal Gürsel was not very happy with Türkeş. Toward the end of the year, Türkeş became even more ambitious. At some point, Türkeş demanded complete control over cultural and religious institutions (control on ministry of education directorate of religious affairs etc.). He was willing to use those institutions for propaganda. So, Cemal Gürsel and some members of NUC decided to get rid of Türkeş. Eventually, in November 1960, they disbanded the NUC, they said they were going to establish a new one. In this process, they excluded 14 radical members from the new NUC, one of which was Türkeş. 

-We do not see any ideological references among the coup-makers or a unity in politics after the coup.
--------------------------------------------------

-1961 Constitution-

-The military formed a "constituent assembly". In this Constituent Assembly, some people were elected, and some were appointed. Of course NUC members were members of the Constituent Assembly. Also some bureaucrats, university professors, and representatives from RPP and Osman Bölükbaşı's Millet Partisi were invited to contribute to the constitution-making process. However, DP (Democrat Pary) was shut down in September 1960. So there were no representatives from DP in the constitution-making process. Therefore, this can be considered as one of the weaknesses of this constitution-making process. 



-Comparison of 1924 Constitution and 1961 Constitution-
1924 Constitution was made only a year after the proclamation of republic. So they had a very important reform agenda, and also they had to have the unity in aim between especially the legislative and the executive. This was a very typical example of assembly government. The relationship between the legislative and executive was very close, and this was easy to maintain because there was a one-party order. But some issues started to emerge as a result of the transition to multi-party system. We observe a lot of problems of majoritarianism in the DP era.


-> ⭐️So, the main aim of the 1961 Constitution was to prevent power monopoly, as in the DP era.
So there was a strong desire to distribute the sovereignty among the state organs. So, they decided to legislation process more difficult. So they brought bicameral legislation, in which there was a second chamber (Senate). The Senate members had to be at least 40 years old, and they had to have university degree. 

-All of the NUC members became automatically the members of the Senate. So, NUC members used the Senate as a legal shield to protect themselves.

-Also former presidents of Turkey was considered members of the Senate (only İnönü because Bayar was busy with the trials).

-Every 3 years, one third of the people in the Senate were elected by popular vote.

-In 1959, RPP had suggested that a constitutional court should be established. But AYM was established with the 1961 Constitution.

-1961 Constitution was a much more democratic one than the 24 constitution.

-In 1961 Constitution, there was also a mention of ⭐️SPO (State Planning Organization). With 1961, a  new economic model was introduced, a more planned approach to economy. Menderes was allergic to planning. SPO prepares plans every 5 years (first in 1963). 

-Also some important bureaucrats grew out of the SPO. So it was in a sense an important educative institution.


--⭐️New Election Law: proportional representation was introduced.

----------------------------------------------------

-1960 coup is a coup, not a revolution because military inserted themselves into the political system.

-The military was given for the first time a constitutional role through the establishment of a National Security Council.

-Also through the establishment of OYAK, military also inserted itself into the economic system of Turkey. OYAK improved the economic standing of military members.

-The Issue of Presidency: Starting from Cemal Gürsel up until Turgut Özal, all of the four presidents of Turkey were from military. But there was not such a rule saying that president should be a former military member.

-The members of tribunals were clearly biased toward DP members.

-Talat aydemir failed 2 coup attempts.

----------------------------------------------------


-1961 Elections onwards till 1971 Memorandum-

-The officers who carried out the coup formed. a committee called NUC and ruled the country for 16-17 months.

⭐️As a result of the coup, political parties were shut down. In February 1961, new political parties were formed. The coup-makers wanted a loyal political party that would fill the gap left by the DP but not challenge the boundaries set by the military regime. 

->⭐️The main party that followed the DP became a party called Justice Party. This party was very prominent in the 60s and the 70s as the followup of the same tradition. The leader of the Justice Party was a former military officer (Ragıp Gümüşpala). This was because they thought that if they found someone from a military background, they would not bother military and attract unnecessary attention of them. It was catch all party.


->The other party that followed the DP tradition was New Turkey Party. This party was established by Ekrem Alican, who was a former DP member. He was also one of those who in the 1950s left the DP and formed Hürriyet Partisi. Regarding economic issues, this party was closer to the Justice Party. However, regarding rights and liberties, it was closer to RPP.

->The third party was Republican Peasant's Nation Party. In the 1958 Osman Bölükbaşı's Nation Party and the Peasant's Part had merged to form this party. This party was somewhat conservative and more provincial. Although Bölükbaşı had a lots of problems with Menderes, this party as well can be a continuation of the DP's tradition.

->The fourth party that joined the 1961 elections was the RPP, led by İnönü.


--⭐️After these parties were created, in February, 8 months before the elections, all these parties signed a joint statement with the NUC. In that statement, they said that they will not defend DP, make a propaganda of religion or talk about a radical change of the order. Also they said that they would respect  the results of the elections.

-During the same party another party was created, but it did not joined the 1961 elections (Workers Party of Turkey). This party did not join 1961 elections because it was formed by a number of trade unionists and some civil society activists, but they did not have a solid leadership inside the party. They could not complete their preparation process that is required to qualify to join the elections. The year later after its founding Mehmet Ali Aybar became the leader.


-⭐️⭐️⭐️The results of the 1961 elections were a big disappointment to the NUC because they were hoping that RPP were going to win the elections. Even though the RPP became the first party in the elections, all other parties, namely Justice party, New Turkey Party and Republican Peasant's Nation Party, got more votes in total than the RPP. So clearly, when we look at the results of the elections, it was the victory of Menderes' legacy. RPP received only 37 percent of the votes. As a result, a coalition government had to be created. This would be the first coalition government in Turkey's history. After the result of the elections came in, a group inside the army called Turkish Armed Forces Union said that they do not recognize the results of this elections, and a new coup was necessary. They thought that they should make a coup before the opening of the parliament. However, Cevdet Sunay, the General Chief of Staff at the time, stepped in to bring people together and to find a middle solution. As a result, 9 days after the elections, a new joint protocol was signed between the military and these parties that joined the elections. Once again these parties made a number of promises to the military. They promised that there would not be any amnesty to the DP members, and that the retired officers expelled from the army a year ago by the military regime would not come back. Also they promised that Cemal Gürsel would be the next president of Turkey.

-Because of the new elections law, the seats were distributed according to proportion of the votes.

-From 1961 to 1965, İnönü were in charge of Turkey, under different coalition governments.

->The first coalition government, which was between RPP and the Justice Party (JP), did not last very long because there was a lot bad blood between these two parties. JP members blamed especially İnönü for provoking the military coup in the 1960. On the other hand RPP was very unhappy because they were willing to introduce some changes in the system such as collective bargaining, right to strike, etc. But those changes were not supported by JP, and JP was pushing hard for an amnesty. 

->⭐️Then as the second coalition government, the RPP formed a coalition with the New Turkey Party and the independents in the assembly. This time, with this second coalition government, collective bargaining and right to strike were given to workers for the first time (Collective Labor Agreement and Strike and Lockout Act) in 1963. During this period, the Ministry of Labor was Ecevit. -After the right to strike was given in 1963, number of trade unions increased significantly, which became a very important base for the leftist developments in Turkey.
-⭐️A major trade union federation was the Confederation of Revolutionary Workers (DISK), which was founded in 1967. 
-⭐️⭐️Another important development was student movements in Turkey. Back in those days there were universities only in Ankara and İstanbul. In those cities, there were debate clubs in universities. Those debate clubs were taken over by student activists. They initially had a lot of sympathy for Workers Party of Turkey around 1965. Later on, all those debate clubs came together to form Devrimici Gençlik in 1969. They had 150 000 members. Deniz Gezmiş and Mahir Çayan became very popular.
-There was a strong anti-American sentiment in Turkey in 1960s and 1970s.
-After 1969 people like Deniz Gezmiş were more attracted to armed guerrilla movements, as their number of seats in the parliament became very low.


->In 1964, RPP formed another coalition government only with independents in the assembly. This also did not last long.

->in 1965, İnönü resigned because he prepared a budget, and it was not approved in the parliament. İnönü a was replaced by a coalition led by Suat Hayri Ürgüplü, an independent in the assembly. Ürgüplü formed a care-taker cabinet. This care-taker cabinet prepared the country for the 1965 elections.



- ⭐️Before the 1965 elections, a new election law was introduced in 1964. This new election law brought a new concept: National Remainder System. This system was  used in only 1965 elections and later abolished. According to this system the remainder votes were distributed equally among the parties that joined the elections, which obviously gives smaller parties a much better chance to have more seats in the parliament. This system was chosen because they did not want the big parties to win the elections. It was clear that Justice Party would win the elections, so they wanted to counterbalance by bringing this system. It was the government led by RPP who chose this party.

-Justice Party won 53 percent of the votes in 1965 elections.

-In 1964, Ragıp Gümüşpala died. Süleyman Demirel became the new leader of the Justice Party. Demirel was an engineer. He was not involved in politics before. He was nicknamed by the RPP as "Çoban Sülo". He was the most important political actor of the second half of the 1960s and beyond. He was also a staunch anti-communist. So, as a right-wing politician, he often resorted to that rhetoric to make his side clear during the cold-war era. In February 1965, Justice Party changed its logo, resorting back to a horse symbol, which is a reference to the DP. 

-⭐️Justice Party is a great example of a catch-all party. That means that Justice Party did not have a specific ideological orientation. They aimed to appeal to a coalition of diverse electoral groups. For instance, they wanted the votes of both working class and the rich class.

-⭐️In the second half of the 1960s, Justice Party, led by Demirel, achieved a high economic growth. Industrialization replaced agriculture, as the major contributor to the national income. In this period, there was also a significant improvement in the living conditions of the working class. Demirel also gave many autonomy to military. 

-⭐️During the second half of the 60s,  the Workers Party of Turkey became a major political party. Thanks to National Remainder System, even though it received 3 percent of the votes, the Workers Party of Turkey joined the assembly with 15 deputies. Those 15 deputies of the party made an effective opposition from 1965 to 1969. 
->⭐️In 1968, Justice Party abolished the National Remainder System because they did not want these small parties to get the same level of representation in the next elections. Despite the small parties, especially the Workers Party, protested this decision, the Justice Party abolished it as they had enough majority in the parliament to do that. 

Also, the Justice Party exploited the anti-communist climate, which was the social current in the country back then, against the Workers Party of Turkey.

-Around 1965 elections, two people emerged within the RPP as crown princess of İnönü: Ecevit and  and Turan Feyzioğlu

-⭐️Workers Party of Turkey became the first party in Turkey to define itself ideologically. It defined itself as socialist. More importantly, it forced other parties to also define themselves ideologically.  ⭐️So, Ecevit and Feyzioğlu prepared a new manifesto which pointed out that "left of center" is the new direction of the RPP. RPP also aimed to compete with the Workers Party of Turkey.

-⭐️In light of the developments in the 1960s, such as industrial development, urbanization, growth of trade unions, leftist movement in Turkey was triggered. Some of these leftist movements became very radical in a very short period of time. However, RPP did not want to be very radical like them. Instead, the RPP aimed to be somewhere left of center, in a similar way as the Justice Party positioned itself somewhere right of center.

-Left of center is basically social democracy. They started to talk about social democracy in the mid 1960s.

-Let alone tolerating left of center, Justice Party started to say that "left of center is the road to Moscow".

-Even though Ecevit worked very hard, positioning the RPP on left of center did not actually yield the desired outcome in the 1965 elections, because İnönü had already lost his popularity due to his coalition governments.


After the right to strike was given in 1963, number of trade unions increased significantly, which became a very important base for the leftist developments in Turkey.
-⭐️A major trade union federation was the Confederation of Revolutionary Workers (DISK), which was founded in 1967. 
-⭐️⭐️Another important development was student movements in Turkey. Back in those days there were universities only in Ankara and İstanbul. In those cities, there were debate clubs in universities. Those debate clubs were taken over by student activists. They initially had a lot of sympathy for Workers Party of Turkey around 1965. Later on, all those debate clubs came together to form Devrimici Gençlik in 1969. They had 150 000 members. Deniz Gezmiş and Mahir Çayan became very popular.
-There was a strong anti-American sentiment in Turkey in 1960s and 1970s.
-After 1969 people like Deniz Gezmiş were more attracted to armed guerrilla movements, as their number of seats in the parliament became very low.


-After 1969 people like Deniz Gezmiş were more attracted to armed guerrilla movements, as their number of seats in the parliament became very low.
-In 1968 some students destroyed US ambassador's car.
-In 1969 Bloody Sunday Events = leftists protested us fleets.

-⭐️Mehmet Ali Aybar, the leader of the Workers Party of Turkey, gave very much importance to democratic means and parliamentary politics. 

-⭐️Not everyone was on the same page regarding the leftist movements in Turkey. In the 1960s also an interesting leftist interpretation of Kemalizim (Doğan Avcıoğlu) emerged, which was basically a synthesis of socialism and Kemalism.  This approach argued that military and intellectuals should work together as they are the most important progressive forces in the society. They argued that different groups have to come together including professors, intellectuals, military officers, and then carry out a national democratic revolution in order for Turkey to become a socialist state. This idea was also popular, and supporters of this idea were criticizing the Workers Party of Turkey, saying that they were playing the game of democracy. Over time, especially with the exclusion of the Workers Party of Turkey from the parliament in 1969 elections, this idea of a socialist revolution gained more popularity among intellectuals and the socialists movements in Turkey.

-In 1968 the Soviet Union occupied çekoslavakya. Soviets said that they were not going to tolerate any departure of ideal socialism. This started a new debate across all socialist parties in the world about whether they should support what Soviets do in favor of socialism no matter what, or they should prioritize democracy as the only way to achieve socialism. Similar debates emerged in Workers Party of Turkey. Aybar was clearly against what Soviets did while Boran supported Soviets. So, this invasion led to a split within the party.
-------------------------------------------------

-"The Right" in Turkis Politics in the 1960s-

-Alparslan Türkeş change the name of Conservative Republican Nation's Party to Nationalist Action Party in 1969.

-They embraced an ideology called "9 Işık", which is based on the importance of conservatism.

-Bozkurtlar, which is a paramilitary group, aimed to intimidate leftists.

-Heart of the Ideal (ülkü ocakları), whose members called themselves Bozkurtlar.



-The National Order Party, led by Erbakan, was established in January 1970. 

-⭐️Erbakan was a conservative guy, who was elected from Konya to be an independent deputy in the assembly in 1969 elections. After that, he formed his new party called "The National Order Party", which was the first Islamist political party.

-------------------------------------------------


-1970s in Turkey-

-In 1970, Ferruh Bozbeyli and a group of people from Justice Party formed a new party called Democratic Party. 

-The leftist movements became much stronger in this period, especially the labor movements. Demirel and his government were having a lot of trouble with the labor movements, and therefore they tried to curb down those labor movements. As they did so, that led to further protests.

-In June 15-16 in 1970, mass demonstrations took place in Kocaeli and İstanbul, with the DISK, which was a revolutionary labor union, as the major actor.

-This national democratic revolution idea of the leftist organizations showed some kind of a place in the military. In 9 March 1971, some military members including Cemal Madanoğlu tried to make a sort of a military coup through socialist means, but they could not make it. 3 days later, on 12 March 1971 a memorandum took place.

-⭐️Through the memorandum, the military intimidated Demirel that if he did not resign, they will make a military coup. They demanded a new government to be formed, which would support the demands of the military. As a result, Demirel resigned. 

-Nihat Erim, who was a traditional figure from the RPP, was made the new prime minister. Nihat Erim established a technocratic government. A technocratic government consists of actors who are professionals in their areas. For example, Atilla Karaosmanoğlu was called back to the country from the World Bank to come and fix the economy.  

-11 cities were ruled by Martial Law from 1971 till 1973, and the law was being renewed every two months. A massive wave of arrests took place especially against the leftist. Even though the leftists during that were thinking the military were more in favor of the leftist organizations, the memorandum of 1971 was actually a movement against leftists.

-After the memorandum of 1971 the Workers Party of Turkey was closed down. On the right, National Order Party of Erbakan was closed down.
-->However in 1972, Erbakan established the National Salvation Party.
-->As a reaction to what was happening with the Memorandum, the leftists made some criminal actions, one of which was the kidnapping of the Israeli Council. Deniz Gezmiş was a part of it. They didn't kill the council, but they demanded their friends arrested to be released. This led to a international crisis. They also made bank robberies, but there was no killing by Deniz Gezmiş.

-Nihat Erim's government was replaced by Ferit Melen's gov. after 14 months. 
----------------------------------------------

-1972 Constitutional Amendments (44 articles were amended):

-The military argued that 1961 Constitution was in favor of too much freedoms. Therefore, with the 1972 Constitutional amendments, civil liberties, freedom of press, autonomy of universities and autonomy of radio and were curbed. Also power of the Constitutional Court was limited. This was also related to Workers Party of Turkey being very active by going to the Constitutional Court against the Justice Party's law-making decisions. 

-Powers of the "National Security Council" were increased. The National Security Council was a meeting mechanism, which was embedded into system after the 1961 Constitution. National Security council was a meeting where military members met civilian leaders. It was an advisory body. But its power increases with the Memorandum  of 1971 and with the 1980 coup. Its advisory function became  a so-called "binding advice".

-"State Security Courts" were established in order to secure the state from the crimes against it. State Security Courts remained in power till 1976; then they were re-established after 1980 coup. They were abolished in 2000s. There was a military presence in the State Security Courts. Deniz Gezmiş, Yusuf Aslan and Hüseyin İnan were executed at those courts. İnönü was against their execution decision. But Demirel and the Justice 	Party and some members of the RPP voted in favor of their execution. They were sentenced to death.


-After the 1971 Memorandum, the system went back to civilian politics in 1973. The Leftist had no party to represent themselves because Workers Party of Turkey was shut down. Only the left of center was left, with RPP. But the radical right was there with the Nationalist Action Party.

-In 1972, the RPP experienced a huge change, where Ecevit initiated an election campaign to become the leader of the RPP against İnönü. Bülent Ecevit manged to win against İnönü. So, İnönü era ended in 1972.

-----------------------------------------------

1973 ELECTİONS

-proportional representation
-RPP became the first, JP the second, Democratic Party of Ferruh Bozbey, National Salvation Party of Erbakan, Republican Reliance Party of Turan Feyzioğlu, and Nationalist Action Party of Türkiş.

-None of the parties could not get enough votes to form their own government. So, a coalition government had to be formed. ⭐️RPP and National Salvation formed a coalition government, which is called as a marriage of convenience. They had similarities in terms of their mistrust to big businesses, and their favor for small and medium enterprises. Also they were both suspicious towards the American imperialism. 

-----------------------------------------------
-Cyprus Issue:
During the decolonization movements in the 1950s, Cypriots were looking for an independence, but there were two groups living in Cyprus, with the majority of the Greeks and the minority of the Turks. Some groups within within the Greeks demanded not only independence but also unification with Greece. In response, the Turks wanted a division. 
Eventually in 1960, Britain, Greece and Turkey came to an agreement, and signed the London-Zurich Agreements. Also the constitution of Cyprus was signed, which made Cyprus an independent republic without unifying with Greece. All these three countries were given guaranteed positions. That meant that they had the right to intervene to the Island, to bring back the status quo if the status quo was broken.

-Macarios became the President of the Cyprus while Fazıl Küçük became the vice-president. Turkish vice-president also had veto powers so that the majority could not make decisions by themselves without finding a middle way with the Turkish community.

-However, Macarios was a great admirer of unifying with Greece and was not happy with the Constitution created 1960, which gave a considerable power to Turks. 

-⭐️⭐️⭐️In 1964,  Macarios tried to make changes in the constitution to make the Turks minority in the system. In the 1964, İnönü was in charge, and he sent a letter to President Johnson of the US, saying that  they were planning to intervene into Cyprus relying on their guaranteed position. Johnson  answered back saying that it was unacceptable for Turkey to intervene Cyprus because the Greek were also a NATO member. Johnson said that if Soviet attacked because of this actions, US would not help Turkey. Also Turkey were not allowed to use NATO equipment for such an intervention. Eventually, the UN intervened and a sort of a settlement regarding Cyprus was reached.

-In 1967, a coup took place in Greece, and a military regime came to power in Greece. Following that, Makarios said that unification with Greece was not feasible anymore. He said that they would not want to join a rule of military.

-⭐️⭐️⭐️After 1967, Makarios' relationship with Turks in the Island got better. Ironically, in 1974 Turkey intervened to the Island because Makarios was overthroned by a military group of Greeks. Ecevit made this intervention, based on Turkey's guaranteur position. First intervention was on 20 July. The international dynamics was okay with that. However, there was also a ceasefire after the first intervention. However, during the ceasefire, in the August Turkey continued to intervene, which led to a huge international debate. Some International players considered this as an invasion. 
-> As a response, US imposed an arm ambargo on Turkey till 1978. But Ecevit suggested that the arm embargo by the US was not actually because of the Cyprus Crisis, but because of the opium crisis. Turkey was a great producer and exporter of opium. US demanded from Demirel to stop production of opium. But Demirel did not want it. But after the 1971 Memorandum, Nihat Erim accepted this demand of US, and they signed a deal, according to which the US would pay a certain amount of money in return. When Ecevit came to power in 1973, he brought back the opium production as opium production was a very important agricultural product for peasants and Turkey back then.

-⭐️⭐️⭐️Even though the Cyprus issue caused an international crisis, Ecevit became a national hero domestically. As a result of this, Ecevit did not want to continue with the coalition with Erbakan because he believed that he had enough popularity to gain enough majority in an early election to form a government by himself. Hence, he resigned expecting an early election to happen. However, this proved to be an epic fail for Ecevit because Demirel managed to bring all those small parties with different ideologies into a coalition, which was formed as the "Nationalist Front Governments". Basically, center-right and radical right elements came together to form a coalition. Demirel became the prime minister, but he had to grant lots of ministries to those small parties in order to keep them under the coalition. So, those small parties were given excessive power. This coalition government was composed of JP, National Action Party, National Salvation Party, some members of Democratic Party of  Ferruh Bozbeyli and the Republican Reliance Party of Turan Feyzioğlu. 
-The main element that kept this coalition together was anti-communism. The left was  totally eliminated in the political arena through the 1971 Memorandum. On the other hand, the radical right represented by the Nationalist Action Party was in the government. 

-Ecevit resigned on 16 September 1974.
-Nationalist Front Governments 1975-1979

-------------------------------------------------

-1977 Onwards Rising Political Violence in Turkey-

Main Events:
-Bloody Events of 1 May 1977
-1977 Elections
-Kahramanmaraş Events

-The radical right was in the government with the Nationalist Action Party, led by Türkiş. On the other hand, the leftists were not represented in the parliament. 

-During this period, political violence rose very quickly.

-Before the 1977 elections, the Nationalist Front government was in charge since 1975. Demirel kept the government in power without  early elections. 

-Before the 1977 elections, 1 May 1977 events happened.

-Bloody 1 May 1977 events were one of the most important incidents of the 1970s.

-On May 1, 1977, about 500.000 people from all around Turkey, led by the DISK, came to Taksim  for the Labor Day meeting. This was considered by the leftists as a show against the nationalist front government because the leftist were seeing the government as fascist. The leftist, who were not represented in parliament, wanted to show its power against the anti-leftist propaganda made by the Nationalist Front government.

-Kemal Türkler was the president of the DISK at the time. He was making a speech when gunshots were heard. Then the panzers came to the square. People tried to run away, but truck was blocking the way in Kazancı hill. Many people were crashed because of this truck. As a result of the event, 34 people died and 26 people were injured. There are many conspiracies about who did this why.

-1977 elections in June is important in that it was the last election before the 1980 military coup. In the 1977 elections, Ecevit's RPP became the the first party. The RPP received about the 42 percent of the votes. 

-National Salvation Party lost about 3 percent of votes, compared to 1973 elections. Nationalist Action Party increased its votes. 

-In 1977 elections, even though the vote rates of parties changed, the formation of the parliament did not change that much because again no party had enough majority form the government by itself. The left, except the RPP, remained again the outside the parliament. Also during this period, the lack of cooperation between different groups within the leftist was the major problem of the leftists. So, the left was fractioned. The only possible solution to reduce the polarization between the right and the left in the society was to form a coalition between the Justice Party and the RPP. However, this coalition could not be realized. 

-Violence increased significantly after 1977 elections. After the elections, Ecevit tried to form a government with independents in the parliament. However this government could not get thevote of confidence from the parliament. Then, Demirel formed the second Nationalist Front government with the National Salvation Party and the Nationalist Action Party. In this government. In this government, the influence of the National Salvation Party and the Nationalist Action Party was than in the first Nationalist Front government. This led to the resignation of 12 members of Justice Party from the party. They denounced the government and said that murders were taking place because of the activities of the Nationalist Front government. So, they decided to vote against the government and therby brought the end of the second Nationalist Front Government.

->In January 1978, Ecevit formed a new cabinet with those who left the Justice Party. (known as Motel Cabinet). Ecevit met with them in Güneş Motel and convinced them to take action together. Thereby, through the support of them Ecevit managed to bring down the second Nationalist Front government and to form his own cabinet. Ecevit offered them ministries in return, and Demirel criticized this situation.  Throughout the Ecevit's government, Demirel said that that government was not legitimate. Hence Demirel called Ecevit not prime minister, but "head of the government" in a sarcastic way.


-We see that during this era, government are continuously changing, and the small parties are getting more and more powerful.


-Kahramanmaraş Events ( May 19-December 26, 1978)
-Alawite-Sünni clash 
-During the Maraş Massacre, Ecevit was the prime minister. In order to control the events, he declared Martial Law in 13 cities and brought military to those places.



-Even though the Ecevit government lasted till October 1979, it could not prevent violence during this period. Terrorism got powerful. Kurdish separatism increased. PKK was established in 1978 by Öcalan.

-The state organs where a huge influence of Nationalist Front Governments were present were giving difficulties to the President Ecevit. So, the government was paralyzed.

-Also the relationship with left was bad during this period as Ecevit criticized workers for being too much militant and disrupting the stability.

-Also Army was uneasy with the situation of the country, and there were some signals of a military intervention.

-Economy was also in a bad condition.

-In October 1979, the elections for the senate was important. As a result of this senate elections, RPP's support declined, and defection from the RPP started in the parliament. So, Ecevit lost the majority and had to resign. Demirel came back to power. However, this time Demirel formed a government with independents, so this was not a nationalist front government. However, leaving them out of the government was not enough to pacify the violence.

-During 1979 and 1980, violence had a categorical change. Not only the killing of the right and the leftists, but also the killing of public figures started to take place now. For instance in 1980, deputy chairman of the Nationalist Action Party was killed. Former Prime minister Nihat erim was killed. DISK leader Kemal Türkler was killed.

-The government appeared to be incapable to restore the order and control the situation.

-There was an interesting incident in Fatsa. The left-wing Mayor of the Fatsa and his supporters proclaimed an independent Soviet Republic in Fatsa. Eventually troops were sent there and end this event.

-In 1980, the number of political murders reached about 30 000, and the violence in  the streets were going on harshly.

--------------------------------------------------

-Turkish Economy during the 1960s and 1970s and its Crisis-

-The increasing political violence was not the only reason for the military intervention in 1980. But also there was also an economic crisis.

-The 1960's an 1970's economic model was based on planning. So, 5-year plan were prepared to achieve steady economic growth.

-The first 5-year plan considered the public investments as the main factor for economic growth and declared the ISI as the main economic model.

-The second and the third 5-year plans emphasized the importance of private sector, and started to consider the public sector as supportive to the private sector. (Second and third plans were more market friendly.)

-These plans' main goal was industrialization. So, social policies was not the priority of these plans. 

-⭐️While the state declared its loyalty to the private sector during this time, it was also continuing to play a significant role in ares where the private sector could not sufficient. Hence, it can be said that the state was the state was adopting a mixed-economic framework in which the interest of the private sector was served by the services and the production provided by the public enterprises.

-Establishment of the SPO through 1961 constitution was crucial for this economic model.

-Both public and private investments had to be compatible the 5-year plans determined by the SPO.
-Investment policies and resource allocations in the long run were made according to this plan.

-After the Justice Party came to power, the targets determined by these plans became more obligatory to the public sector whereas they were more advisory for the private sector. 

-Money, credits and foreign exchange policies were excluded from the scope of these plans created by the SPO.

-Economic model of this period was different from its earlier versions in terms of the content of the industrialization, the distribution of the investment and the priorities of the sectors.

-During these period, state investments made more than 50 percent of the total investments.

-This more inward looking economy aimed to increase the profitability of industry and agriculture while expanding the internal markets by the means of populist income distribution policies. However there were some internal contradictions of the ISI model of this era. For instance, there was the main of aim of decreasing the dependency on foreign resources. However, this aim was not actually compatible with high rates of desired growth because domestic saving level of capital was very low.

-⭐️ISI model is a protectioinst model. The purpose of the model is to produce domestically and sell in the domestic market first. It was aimed that the infant industries that were initially not able to compete with white world market would improve themselves by increasing their capacities  and then, eventually open up to the world. So, the model did not aim to remain protectionist forever.

-The ISI model aimed to meet the domestic demand for durable consumer goods.


-Initially, industry of durable consumer goods startedthe form of assembly, but then it gained a more industrialist characteristics with the contribution of the domestisc capital and supply industry, which was intentionally developed for the purpose of supporting the production of the demanded consumer goods. However, this industry were dependent on other countries in terms of technology and basic inputs.

-At one point, the industry of durable goods started exceeding the needs of the rural and urban bourgeoisie. Thereby, with the economic growth and with the increase in the real income of the workers and the middle class, consumption of durable goods spread to the different segments of the society. So , a lively domestic market arose. For example, the use of radios, refrigerators and cars increased in the rural and worker families.

-In this period, one of the goals was supplying intermediary goods for the private industry, such as iron and steel. In this regard, contribution of the public sector was crucial. So, The State Economic Enterprises produced these intermediary goods for the private industry.

-However unexpectedly, this rapid growth increased the dependency to other countries, rather than creating a market able to compete with the world. The main reason behind this was that investments on technology by the industrialist was rather insufficient during this period.

-Also populist distribution, for example higher wages, policies took place during these period. The increasing power of trade union is one of the underlying elements for this. The regime also wanted more people to be able to buy those products which were domestically produced, in order to boost the economic growth. Hence, the politically dominant groups such as industrialists and landowners had to take into account the interest of the workers and peasants, in order to gain electoral support and for the economic model to function. So, keeping the wages high was important for the economic model to work.

-There were import-restrictions, custom duties and quotas as important elements of the protectionist model. 

-However, unfortunately industrialists during this period, did not care about improving their technologies and reducing their production costs because they were already satisfied with the privileges provided for them through this economic model. Despite the low productivity of the industries, the profitability of the industries were so high. So there was no encouragement for these industrialists to improve their technologies. As a result, the competitiveness of the infant industries could not be attained at the world level. 
-Consequently, rent-seeking industrialist became so strong that monopolies emerged. Also the industrialist were granted the privilege to borrow from the government at very low rates, so it could be said that they were able to accumulate capital at the expense of the treasury.
-They were also provided with cheap input products by the SEEs.


-we basically observe that the import substituting industrialization at the beginning was aiming for development of the industry in Turkey, and they used the public sectors and all the means of the state in a way for the betterment and the development and the development of the industry. However, in the 1970s, systems started not working because of the currency issues. 


-In agriculture, during this period,  peasants were exempted from direct taxes. Peasant were also considered important for electoral support. This was a sort of populist move.


-OYAK was established 1961 constitution. OYAK became a major investor in new industries. For example OYAK Renault. So, the military members, who were having troubles with their wages in the 1950s, gained an economic opportunity with the 1960 coup. (Some economics call this as the third leg of economy, along with the public and private sectors).

-In almost all sectors oligopolies started to emerge. This led those strong companies who were not encouraged to compete in the world market as they were quite satisfied with their domestic profitability. The new industries were mostly located in İstanbul, İzmir, Adana.

-This ISI model was quite successful in its first phases, with the annual growth rate of 7 percent.

-In the industrial sector,  SEEs met the 40 percent of the total industrial production. However, it was not very efficient as the state kept prices lower, and they were being overstaffed due to political concerns.
So, it can be said that the private sector were improving at the expense of the public sector.


-The main weakness of this ISI model was that these new industries were highly dependent on imported foreign materials for their production. Hence, availability of foreign reserves was an issue.

->However, Turkey  were consistently running trade deficit and balance of payments deficit during this period, but they were still getting aids and loans from abroad. Also there were Turkish workers in Germany, who were sending their remittances to Turkey. These gave Turkey a foreign exchange advantage for some time during this period. 

-However, exports decreased because lira was overvalued. Also Turkish goods were low quality, so they could not compete. The only export Turkey made during this period was the export of agricultural goods. However, the foreign reserve extracted from agricultural exports could not meet the buying of the products from abroad that were needed to be bought to produce those industrial goods.

-In the 1960, workers also started to have very important social and political role in Turkey. Many rights regulated in 1961 constitution clearly increased the power of unions, and led to a radical political environment. During 1970s, workers and union were demanding more and more. This was also a problem for the economic model.


Oil Crisis of 1973-1974, and the second oil crisis of 1979-1980
-The oil crisis in 1970s also harmed the economy of Turkey. Due to the oil crises, prices of oil in the world increased tremendously. As Turkey was too increasingly becoming independent oil as the main energy source, this tremendous increase in oil prices meant a significant rise in import expenditures of Turkey. Two thirds of the foreign currency earnings of Turkey was spent to pay for oil. Simultaneously, the Western demand for Turkish exports decreased significantly as a result of the recession in Europe. For a short period of time, it was possible for the Central Bank of Turkey to sell its foreign reserves to cope with the currency issue. In addition, foreign currency transfers from the Turkish workers in Germany helped with this for a while, but these contributions by these workers declined after a while. The National Front governments tried to deal with the currency problem by passing an euro-dollar law, which was a very costly short term strategy.

-Also, printing money led to a very high inflation. They also tried to keep foreign reserves within the country by imposing import restrictions. 

-Oil for industry and electricity became too scarce by 1979. There were many power-cuts, even in the winter, imposed by the government.

-So, the huge increase in energy prices and non-stable financial policies of the successive governments contributed to the inflation. Inflation rate was around 20 percent during the early 1970s whereas it was 90 percent by 1979. So, the government tried to handle inflation through the Price Control board. However this led to black market. Another measure taken by the government to ease down inflation was an artificially high interest rates. There were a number of devaluations. Import restrictions also led to the black market.

-However, those measures taken by the government were not enough to restore the economy. Hence, The Ecevit government in 1978 went to IMF, World Bank and OECD. In 1979, an agreement was reached. According to this agreement, Turkey was given about 1.8 billion new credits, on the condition that the Turkish government would introduce a reform package including removing import and export restrictions, cutting subsidies, freeing interest rates, reducing government expenditures. 

-Demirel returned to power in October 1979, but he continued with the task set by the IMF, and this task was prioritized by this new Demirel government. This task was given to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, who was in charge of planning. This person was Turgut Özal. So, Özal was given the task of conducting this Economic reform package in 1979. In January 1980, he initiated the reform package. Thanks to the reform package, the credits from outside started to arrive. As a part of this reform package, there was a significant devaluation of the lira. 

-However, during the spring of the 1980, there was a widespread resistance. It can be said that the 1961
Constitution and the right to strike given to workers became an obstacle against the reform program because the reform program was hitting the workers more during the time. There erupted strikes in many places. So, the reform program launched by Özal in the January 24, 1980 could not be implemented. The reform program was offering the so-called Chilean solution, which was based on neo-liberal economic policies.

-But wee see that the military coup of 1980 enables paves the way for the reform package to be applied.

-------------------------------------------------


-1980 Military Coup and the 1982 Constitution-

Military rule after the 1980 coup, lasted from 1980 till 1983. This was the longest period that Turkey was ruled under military rule.

According to some people 1961-1980: second republic, 1980-onwards: third republic

-Özal entered the cabinet of Süleyman Demirel as the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs.
-In 24 January 1980, a new reform package prepared by Turgut Özal was announced. This program was Süleyman Demirel, who became the prime minister again in 1979.
⭐️The main goal of this reform package was to switch from the ISI model to a new economic model, where the main concern was to switch to an export-led economic growth.

-The Reform Package included a huge devaluation of TL. In return for that credits began to land in Turkey. Also, subsides for some sectors were abolished. Worker's wages would be reduced to gain competitive advantage according to this package. The aim was to liberalize the Turkish economy, and to integrate it into the world economy. However, this reform program was not received well by the workers in Turkey. They protested the reform package. They were critical of the neoliberal economy. So, the resistance of the workers to the reform package can be said to be one of the main reasons why the 1980 coup happened.

-One of the factors that triggered the coup was the increasing problems in law and order, such as victims of political violence.  There were many killings of both political figures and ordinary people.

-Also the Kurdish separatist movement were gaining momentum during that time in Turkey. Pkk was formed in 1984, but during this period we see the beginnings of it. So, this was seen as an alarming development for the military. The impact of pkk became much stronger after 1980 coup, mainly due to the cruel treatment of the military regime in the Diyarbakır Prison. This further politicized the Kurdish people.

-Also, political system in Turkey was in a state of deadlock. For example, Fahri Korutürk's term of presidency came to an end in the April 1980. So, the parliament had to choose a new President. However, the harsh rivalry between Ecevit and Demirel led to major deadlock in choosing the new President. By the time of the military Coup in September 1980, the parliament still could not decide on who would be the next President. (Korutürk 1973-1980 presidency term)


-Of course, the economic crisis in the late 1970s was an important factor for the coup. Especially after 1979, the large part of the foreign currency was spent to meet the oil bill.

-Another factor that triggered the coup in 1980 was the growing influence of the Iranıan Islamic Revolution in 1979. Additionally, during that time the Israeli state declared Jerusalem to be its eternal capital. This caused huge protests in the Muslim world. In Turkey, only 6 days before the 1980 our happened, a mass demonstration took place in Konya, organized by the Municipality of Konya. Necmettin Erbakan was among the participants in this demonstrations. At some point, the Turkish National Anthem had to be sung, and some people there refused to sing the national anthem. This also led to huge unrest in the military. Many people consider as the last drop on full glass, for the military coup.

-Akıncılar-> an islamist group in Turkey


-Kenan Evren, back then the General Chief of Staff, was the face of the 1980 coup. People did not now whether this coup in the 1980 would be in favor of the left or the right. For instance, Türkeş wanted to understand to which direction the wind was blowing. He was not sure what was going to be hurt after the coup, so he went into hiding. 

-After the coup, the activities of the political parties and MISK and DISK were suspended. Political party leaders were arrested. 

-State of Emergency was declared.

-Military officers who carried out the coup formed the "National Security Council" (NSC), to run the affairs of the state. This is the counterpart of NUC of the 1960 coup.

-Kenan Evren was declared as the head of the state. A New cabinet was formed by Bülent Uusu, prime minister from 1980 til 1983.

-⭐️Even though the cabinet formed after the 1980 coup was military-oriented, there was one civilian in this cabinet, who retained his position from the previous government: Özal. Turgut Özal was now given the full control of the economy. So, it can be said that a new economic model could be dictated only through a military coup.

-⭐️Özal's continuity was a notable aspect of this new economic model because he had prepared the reform package before the coup, and now had the full control on the economy under the military regime. After 1983, he became the prime minister.
-Bankers Crisis happened in 1982. Hence Özal was forced to resign, but he came back as the prime minister after the 1983 elections.
-Özal became President in 1989.
-Özal were able to implement his economic policy without facing much difficulties.


-After the coup, the whole country was divided into regions, and local commanders were given extensive powers.

-⭐️After June 1981, the National Security Council (NSC)decree said that political matters cannot be discussed in public

-In 1982, a NSC decree said that the old politicians cannot talk about past, present and future publicly.

-All political parties were shutdown on 16 October, 1980. NSD decided to confiscate all possessions of the old parties including their archives.

-The 1960 coup was against menderes and the Democrat Party, in the 1971 Memorandum the actual goal was to suppress the rise of the leftist movements. ⭐️However, the main goal of the 1980 coup was to destroy the entire political landscape. Both leftists and rightists (especially the Bozkurtlar) were targeted by the coup. 

-YÖK was established in order to put universities in a tight centralized control. YOK directly appointed all rectors and deans of universities. So, the autonomy of universities was largely eliminated.
--------------------------------------------


1982 CONSTITUTION

⭐️1961 cons. aimed to counterbalance the power of the legislative and executive organs. However, through the 1982 constitution, because of the unstable environment and the instability of governments especially in 1970s, the coup-makers wanted to increase the powers of the executive (President and council of ministers). Also powers of National Security Council increased with the 1982 constitution whereas its position was confined to suggestions mainly about National security with the 1961 constitution. Now with the 1982 cons., some of the policy recommendation from the military wing became binding to the politicians.


⭐️Everything regarding rights and liberties such as freedom of press, rights of trade unions and rights of individuals, were largely limited with the 1982 Constitution. Rights and freedoms were defined on the basis of national security issues.

-The senate was shut down. Bicameral legislation was abolished.
-Reestablishment of State Security Courts, to cope with crimes committed against the State. State Security Court system was abolished in 2004.


Referandum of the 1982 Constitution was going to make Kenan Evren the President automatically. The referandum's result was 91 percent "yes" vote. So Evren became the president.

----------------------------------------------

LAW ON PARTIES and  NEW ELECTION LAW (1983):

-New election law was prepared. According to this law, proportional representation with a 10 percent threshold came into effect in order to ensure stability in government.

⭐️-Politicians who have been active before 1980 September were banned from politics for ten years. 10 years for leaders and 5 years for other politicians.

-Approval of NSC needed to establish new parties
⭐️-Students, teachers and civil servants were not allowed to be members of political parties.
⭐️-Political parties were not able to open up youth and women branches.

->⭐️⭐️⭐️Coup-makers' main goal was to depoliticize the society because in the 1960s and 70s, politics had dominated the system, and this led to excessive polarization within the society. So, the military wanted confine the political sphere only to politicians and political parties by those restrictions  on political parties above. So, the military aimed to keep the society away from the politics as much as possible.

----------------------------------------------


-The Rise and Fall of Turgut Özal's Motherland Party (ANAP) and the neoliberal economic model in Turkey-



-15 parties were found before the 1983 elections, but NSC decided that 12 parties out of those 15 were unacceptable. The only three parties allowed by the NSC to join the 1983 elections were: Party of Nationalist Democracy Party (led by retired general Turgut Sunalp), Motherland Party, and  Populist Party (led bey Necdet Calp).

Nationalist Democracy Party (center-right), Populist Party (center-left). 

-Because of Özal's harsh history with the workers due to 24 January 1980 reform packages and the Banker's Crisis in 1982, NSC thought that Özal would not receive too many votes in the 1983 elections. Hence, the NSC allowed Turgut Özal's ANAP to become the third party alongside Nationalist Democracy Party and the Populist Party. Through these three parties, the return to democracy from the military regime was carried out.

-The main propaganda of Özal for the 1983 elections was  improving economic conditions of lower classes and making them middle classes. (For example property for those who live in shanty towns in cities). However, ironically, the economic model implemented during this era led to the erosion of the middle class.

-⭐️Military also wanted to draw on  the Turkish-Islamic synthesis. The military made a lot of reference to the traditional values of Islam and of the Turkish identity in order to unite the society and keep it away from polarizing. For instance, after the 1980 military coup, religious classes were made compulsory for the first time. Also citizenship classes were made compulsory too. 

-Turgut Özal as well made use of these elements of Islam and Turkish identity. Motherland Party was a catch-all party. That means, it was a center party aiming to appeal to everyone, in order to achieve a great electoral success. The Motherland Party defines itself as nationalist, conservative, traditionalist, and also it stood for social justice. So, ANAP wanted to be moderate and balanced on the values above not the scare away their potential electorates.

Özal had edicts in name of law issued by NSC which was transferred from Bülent ulusu. Özal had important power in his hand.

1983 elections->ANAP became the first party with 45% of the votes. The Nationalist Democracy Party, which was mostly supported the military, became the last with 23%. 

-------------------------------------------------


1984 Local Elections

-Three more new parties were allowed by the NSC to join the local elections: 
-Social Democratic Party, led by Erdal İnönü
-True Path Party, supported by Demirel from the background as he was banned
-Welfare Party, supported by Erbakan in the backdoor as he was banned.

⭐️The results of the 1984 local elections demonstrate that the two opposition parties in the parliament. On the other hand, ANAP received a close amount of votes to the 1983 elections. So, there emerged a legitimacy crisis on the part of the opposition in the parliament because the new parties that entered the system were preferred more by the society, but they were not represented in the parliament. As a result, the Populist Party united with Social Democratic Party to become the Social Democratic Populist Party. Thereby, the members of Social Democracy party found a representation in the parliament. This was how the legitimacy crisis were solved. 

-The National Democratic Party dissolved itself. Therefore, the members of it in the parliament, joined either the ANAP or the True Path Party. 

-Also the Democratic Left Party had been established by Rahşan Ecevit. Some member of the Populist party joined there. So, Democratic Left Party also got a small representation in the parliament until the next elections. 

------------------------------------------------

-Starting from the late 1970s, many countries started to switch to neoliberal economic model. United States, United Kingdom.

After oil crisis and recession years capitalist world came up with new solution: neo liberal economy. They thought that Keynesian model does not work anymore so new model is necessary.


-Open global economy without trade barriers, the state intervention is minor while private sector is the key actor. Also, financial institutions are important.

-Özal was inspired by Pinochet in Chili. He applied similar policies to boost industrialization and enter more liberal economy.

-Export oriented economy.

-When the economy crashed in Turkey in the late 1970s, Ecevit was In charge and had to go to the IMF. IMF usually suggests to open up the economy, cut state subsidies, reduce state expenditures and devaluate the home currency. Then, Demirel came to power and called Özal to help restructure the economy according to demands of the IMF. As a result, Özal came up with the January 24, 1980 decisions, which marked the beginning of the export-oriented economic model in Turkey. The goal was to make Turkey competitive in the global market and boost exports. The cheap labor and devaluated lira were also parts of this reform package. The aim was to gain more foreign currency through more exports.

The reform package of 24 January Decisions:
-Devaluation : to make Turkish products more competitive in foreign market
-Cutting state expenditures
-Ending unlimited state employment
-Increasing prices of the SEE's products
-Liberalization of trade
-Abolishment of subsidies given by the ISI model. They don't want domestic live market whereas they want to produce and sell it abroad to get foreign currency to turkey.
-Encouraging FDI
-Export subsidies
-Privatization of SEEs
-Curbing the power of trade unions and curbing down the workers' wages.
-freezing rates: competitive advantage by labor prices.

-freeing interest rates->Banker's crisis: it did not bring venture capital increase in investment. Which was the aim. Bankers flooded bonds which big banks would not touch. Public started to buy these bonds. When government started to put regulations on who can get credit many banker firms collapsed. As a result, several politicians resigned including Özal. This was caused by people's willingness to earn more money and beat inflation.


-Simplification of bureaucratic procedures-> lack of state regulation was an issue.
-praise of individualism
-tax rebates for importers
-suppression of trade unions after the coup
-banned strikes
-lower real wage for workers


-⭐️The reform package brought by the 24 January 1980 decisions could only be applied after the coup. With the coup, the military suppressed the trade unions and banned strikes. Also, there were populist concerns of elected governments, political violence. Thereby, there was no obstacle left to implement the reform package. 

-The 1960s and 70s in Turkey was the era of workers and trade unions while starting from 1980s, it is the era of capitalists.

-When Özal became the prime minister in 1983 and started applying the new model, exports grew significantly in the first years. Manifactured good were exported more. Turkish textile became important.
 
-Anatolian tigers emerged. Many small and medium enterprises gained the opportunity to sell their products abroad and earn additional wealth. They grew significantly in this model. The Anatolian tigers tend to be mone conservative in politics. Once they became wealthy, in the 1990s it was important which parties they would vote for and give financial supports. They became like a new bourgeoisie class. 

-Tourism sector became an important factor in the economy in terms of attracting more foreign currency.

-Infrastructure and large building projects. (2nd Bosphorus bridge, TEM highway, GAP project)

"Build-Operate-Transfer" model emerged so that private sector make huge investments without state spending a lot of money.

-Telecommunication network-> private tv and radio for the first time. Also private airline companies.

-Luxury goods became an element in the economy. Rich were getting richer.


-PROBLEMS OF ÖZAL'S ECONOMIC MODEL:
-Özal's desire to achieve very rapid results. -> Balance of Payment crisis starting from 1987

-Low focus on structural reforms. He gave less importance to building a strong institutional infrastructure. Lack of regulations

-Lack of planning

-Weak focus on inflation caused a jump in 1980s 

-Failure to curb the growth of the civil service due to populist policies for electoral concerns

-nepotism (favoring friends and relatives; for example, privileges for some groups in privatization) 

-corruption

-inefficient taxation (Value added tax hit wage earners more as they now had today tax for everything they buy.)

-Fictitious exports 

-Immature liberalization of the capital account in 1989. ---> This led to capital volatility and financial instability in the later phases of the Turkish Economy.

-Uneven income distribution. The gap between rich and poor widened.

-Change in consumption patterns

-----------------------------------------------


Return of the Old Guards (banned politicians)- 1987 Referandums

These banned politicians were banned till 1992 due to the 10-year ban imposed after the coup. However, they were becoming aggressive in the backdoor. Hence, Özal suggested to make a referandum regarding whether or not people would like those banned politicians to come back. The result of the referandum was "yes" with the 50.2 percents of the votes. As a result, the old politicians were now allowed to come back. Under normal circumstances, general elections was going to be in 1988. However, due to the result of this referandum, Özal decided to make an early election (1987 Early Elections).

In the early elections of 1987, Özal's Motherland Party managed to become the majority party in the parliament, thanks to three parties not being able to pass the threshold of 10 percent.  DY led by Demirel third, and SODEP, led by İnönü, became the second

-The Nationalist Working Party, led by Türkeş, was the continuation of the Nationalist Action Party.

-------------------------------------------------

1989 Local Elections:
 -In the 1989 local elections, the Motherland Party lost its first position for the first time, losing about 15 percent of its votes. SODEP became the first party. DY became the third.  As a result of this local election, the opposition in the parliament argued that this was also a legitimacy crisis, so they demanded an early general election. However, Özal did not go for an early election. In 1989, Kenan Evren's term of presidency was going to end. So, Özal decided to run for President. As the ANAP had the majority in the parliament, they could chose Özal as the next President in the third round. So, he had to left his position as the president of the party. So, he became the second civilian President after Celal Bayar. He left his position to Yıldırım Akbulut, so Akbulut became the prime minister. In 1991 Mesut Yılmaz became the leader of ANAP.

1991 Elections:

-Gulf War izle.

------------------------------------------------


The Rise of Political Islam in Turkey (Turkish Politics since 1980)

The concept of secularism refers to the separation of state affairs and religion. 
In theory, according to secularism, state has to treat all religious beliefs equally.  However, in practice, we see that through constitutions, states may regulate religious beliefs and practices to an extent, depending on the culture and historical background of the country. Regulations of state regarding religion can be seen in areas such as teaching of religion, providing subsidies to religious schools and payments of salaries of religious institutions.

-Some studies show that especially since the 19th century, the influence of religion on public life is decreasing. Most societies are becoming increasingly secular mainly because of socioeconomic developments, not because of dedicated secular movements.

-However, it is also evident that show that religion made a comeback due to the frustrating conditions of the modern life. This is considered by many as a religious revival. Almost everywhere in the world, there is an increasingly growing sense that we are facing a moral collapse, and that religion can help us cope with this. Some people look into spiritual things they think they can offer us a path.


Two predominant approaches to religion:

According to the American approach, religious communities should be left to their own devices. So, there should be no state institutions regulating religions since religion is a reserved part of individual rights and freedoms. They think that if state would regulate religious activities of individuals, it would led to violation of freedom. So it is best for the state to play passive role.  (Secularism)

According to the French approach, absence of regulation of religion by the state is risky because if there is no such regulation, some groups may impose its religious belief on others. Hence, religion is ought to be subordinate to the state. The French concept "Laicite" means that religion's influence on state should be minimized. Desire to restrict if not eliminate the effects of religion over the state. They say that the goal is group in the society might dominate the other groups in the society. What if some group impose its ideology to other group. This French version is more closer to Ataturk's version.

When we look at Turkey, we see that Turkish version is closer to the French approach to religion as the founding fathers adopted the idea that the state should control religion.



SECULARISM AND POLITICAL ISLAM IN TURKEY

-The founding fathers of Turkey aimed to transform the whole society into a modern society. They did not just want to change institutions. So, they regarded traditional beliefs and superstitions as a threat to their project of a modernized society. ⭐️So, the founding elite applied policies to remove religion from the public realm and reduce it to a matter of faith and practice of individuals. The principle of freedom of belief protected only individualized religion. 

-After the republic was founded, the founding fathers implemented laicist regulations to protect the new state structure they established. They abolished the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Pious Foundation in March 1924. They preferred to run religious affairs through an administration rather than with an Ministry. This administration was called Directorate of Religious Affairs. So this way, the ruling elite took religion under its control. This was also a strategic move to make sure that this person would not enjoy the prestige of a caliph as a religious authority.  

-In March 1924, also medreses were closed through the law on unfication of education. With this law, all organizations and matters regarding education were taken under the control of Ministry of Education. It was regulated in the same law that the Ministry Education was going to open a faculty of theology in İstanbul University to train religion experts Additionally, with this law, preacher schools were opened up. Also on this same day, the Caliphate was abolished (1924).

-However, over the next few years, many preacher schools and the faculty of theology were closed down. Religious course were removed from curriculum. High schools middle schools vb.

-From 1930 till late 1940s, there was no religious education in the Turkish educational system.


-the Rejection of Mecelle and adoption of the Swiss Civil code in 1926
-The adoption of the latin alphabet in 1928.

-The sentence in the 1924 Constitution which stated that "devletin dini İslamdır" were removed in 1928.

-1937 secularism entered Turkish constitution.

-Abolition of sheria courts.

-⭐️ATATÜRK wanted to remove religion from social realm and to confine it to the conscience of individuals. 
-⭐️The purpose during this period was to secularize not only the state and the political sphere but also the society.

-Paradox here they did not want to discard religious all together, they wanted to monitor. They had an idea of joining universal civilization. They thought that this is best achieved by looking into Europe. So, they abandon Islam as civilization project. Paradox here is that even they abandon Islam as a project and embarked the idea of joining universal civilization, they forgot that Turkish state was dominantly Muslim. For example, unless declared otherwise every child born in turkey registered as Muslim. 

-The early republican reforms did not aim to discard religion completely, but rather aimed to took it under its control. 

-It is a paradox that even though the founding leaders of Turkey denied Islam as a civilization project and adopted the path of contemporary civilization, they continued to imagine the Turkish nation as Muslim. For example, the founding fathers created the Directorate of Religious Affairs in order to carry out services about the Islamic faith and practices such as administration of the places of worship. Even the Friday sermons were prepared by the Directorate of Religious Affairs. All imams in mosques were appointed by this Directorate. All these expenditures regarding the religion, such as the salaries of Imams, were paid by the state. These were actually pragmatic strategies applied by the founding father to keep Islam and the majority of the country under the control of the state.

-However, as to the representation of other religions and beliefs, there were no endorsement by the state. So, we can say that the other beliefs were ignored. The Directorate carried out service only for the Muslim population. This was based on Hanefi-Sünni Islam. This is also against the idea of Islam. Because in Islam if you are muslim that's what matters. But here directorate of religios affairs was trying to create desirable individual.

-So other type of religions or other type of muslim practices other than hanefi sunni were ignored. Directorate focused on one type of reiligion practice. And payments received by them are tax revenues which were gathered from all types of people in the society.


-Some groups blamed the founding leaders for being disrespectful to the religious heritage of the Ottomans and for reducing traditional values to a secondary status.


-In the Multi-Party era, we see a gradual loosening of secularist application in Turkey.

 In 1947, at the seventh congress of the RPP, the issue of religious education once again came to the agenda. Thereby, they wanted to regain the support of people that they lost in 1920s and 30s.

-In 1949, a theology faculty in Ankara was opened up. In 1949, a course about religions knowledge was introduced as an optional class for fourth and fifth grade students. In the DP era, this course was extended to middle schools, and in the Justice Party era, it was extended to highschools.

Normally, families were writing a petition if they wanted their kids to take this optional religious class. However, the DP made a procedure that the families who did not want their children to take this course should have written a petition about this. Therefore, some families felt under pressure about stating their views about religion (both parents and students). (OPT-IN, OPT-OUT)

-1950 Ezan back to Arabic in the early democrat pert era.

-Preacher school were opened again by the DP government in 1951, as a response to the demand from people.


-Starting with the Democrat Party, center-right parties significantly made use of Islam as a legitimizing ideology. They aimed to appeal to religious conservative electoral groups. The same trend continued even more aggressively with the Justice Party in the 1960s. Until the late 1960s, Islamist tendencies were not allowed to form political organizations.

-As the democracy became reinforced in the country, Islamists found an opportunity to reincorporate themselves into the political system. 


-The first Islamist politican that was recognized throughout Turkey was Necmettin Erbakan.  In 1969, Erbakan
was elected president of the Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Erbakan criticized Demirel and Justice Party for being subservient to big business owners and foreign capital. He also denounced JP for being a means of Freemasons and Zionists.

-Erbakan formed several parties between 1970 and 2000, either directly by himself or indirectly because of his political ban. All those parties of him adopted the ideology of "national vision" (milli görüş). Here, the word "nation" refers to an authentic conservative Muslim Turkish identity. Erbakan led this movement of national vision for thirty years. Then, RTE emerged as a leader this same movement.

According to the "national vision" ideology, there is a basic struggle between Islamic and Western civilizations. They argue that Islamic civilization is based on justice whereas Western civilization is based on pressure. They argue that imitation of the West led the Ottomon Empire to lose its power. They regard the Republican reforms as an imitation of the West as well.


-The purpose of the national output movement was to create a political synthesis of Islam and modernizm. They interpreted modernizm as a scientific and technological process, which is fully separated from cultural and social transformation. So, the key mentality was a spiritual development through Islam and a material development through industrialization.

-Erbakan was a supporter of heavy industrialization.

-National output movement parties considered the capitalism as a monopolistic economic system. They criticized this sort of capitalism. However they were not against private sector. They focused on the small businesses that could not sufficiently improve due to monopolistic capitalist system. They put emphasis on small and medium businesses.

-⭐️In 1970, Erbakan formed the National Order Party, the first party of the political Islam.  In the earlier periods of 1970s, the political Islam could not attract many votes. Also, ⭐️after the 1971 Memorandum, the Constitutional Court banned the National Order Party for using religion for political purposes.However, Erbakan himself was allowed to continue his political activities. In 1972, He formed National Salvation Party. In 1974 he formed a coalition government with Bülent Ecevit, however this coalition ended as Ecevit resigned in 1974.

-In the second half of 1970s, Erbakan was in Nationalist Front governments. 
-After 1980 coup, he was banned from politics.
-In 1983, supporters of Erbakan established a new party, Welfare Party.

-Even though he returned to politics in 1987, Welfare Party could not meet the 10 percent threshold in 1987 elections.

-In spite of official restrictions on political Islam, Islam had a significant amount of support after 1980. Many politicians of including the Motherland Party, including Özal, were influenced by the ideology of group known as "Heart of the Enlightened", whose purpose was to eliminate the monopoly of left-oriented intellectuals on the social and political sphere. They held seminars. İbrahim Kafeosoğlu was the leader of the organization and he supported the Turkish Islamic synthesis. Mission of Turkish was two be the soldier of Islam according to this. 

->In the late 1970s, this ideology became were popular on the political right. Interestingly, the military officers, who were raised in a strict secularism tradition, this Turkish-Islamic synthesis appealed to well-known military leaders, especially to Kenan Evren. The military during this era saw communism as an enemy of Turkey, and they liked this synthesis in that it was a combination of strong nationalism and a state-friendly version of Islam. We can say that it is not a coincidence that after the 1980 coup, religion and citizenship courses were made compulsory.
->After 1983, this synthesis became a very important principle followed by Özal to gain support from people.

->There is also an economic aspect of the Islamic revivalism in 1980s. A new economic group called Anatolian Tigers emerged in Anatolia in 1980s, who has adopted conservative values but also rational business rules. They were very motivated by the high profits offered to them by the new capitalist system. Many entrepreneurs from a background of small and medium enterprises in Anatolian cities, they expanded their capacity in this period. They improved their business significantly and seek to expand to new markets. This led to new patterns of consumption.
Economic liberalization polices of the Özal period highly contributed to the formation and acceleration of the Anatolian Tigers. They became an important driving force in the economy especially in the late 1980s and 1990s. Anatolian tigers were socially conservative, but economically liberal.

-Islam gained a new visibility in the society. Islamic elements increased, such as building of new mosques, significant growth in the number of preacher schools, whose graduates were now allowed to universities. Also religious content was increasing in textbooks.

-Welfare Party were considered by many as a marginal political party. Many were concerned about the secular Turkey. 

-⭐️In the late 1980s, the debate regarding secularism was concentrated on the ban of wearing headscarf in public buildings, especially in universities. Islamist students protested that. Motherland party supported this protests and they even passed a law that would remove this ban. However, Kenan Evren carried this law to the Constitutional Court, and the Constitutional Court declared that the law was unconstitutional. ⭐️Finally in December 1989, a decree was issued that lifted the ban and left it to the rectors of universities to decide on allowing the headscarf. However this debate upon headscarf led to further politicization of the issue in the public opinion. In the late 1990s, the issue became much controversial.



The ideology and organizational structure of Welfare Party:
-Just order (the main slogan of the party in 1991 and 1995 elections)-> elimination of social inequality and corruption.-Social solidarity, justice in taxation, equal treatment in allocation of state credits, abolition of interest -State withdrawal from economic activities- support for individual small enterprises.- The promise of the party was to deal with poverty and to end the western influence on Turkey. They referred to "national pride". They tried to appeal to many different groups in the society. 

-This was a period when the Kurdish problem peaked. Welfare Party also tried to appeal to Kurds by taking them under the umbrella of Islam.

-While the rest of the parties were usually demonizing the supporters of other parties, Welfare Party aimed to appeal to everyone. They had something to say to everyone (prostitute, new graduates, urban people etc.).

-nepotism and corruption was criticez by them

-They had a very effective organization model called "string model", in which they know everyone by their first names in the neighborhoods in order to reach out to people and take care of their daily problems. This created a sentiment of belonging. Women organization was also critical in the success of the Welfare Party.

---------------------------------------------

1990s

-1990s is a period that is economically and socially very fragile.
-Economic crisis was getting deeper because of the Özal's policies. Even though Turkey initially had a boom between 1983- 1986 with Özal's policies, after 1987 inflation started to rise dramatically, and economy was heading to a crisis.

-1993 was an eventful year. In January 1993, Uğur Mumcu, a famous investigative journalist, was assassinated. In April 1993, Özal died, and Demirel, who was the prime minister at that time, became the next President. So, as Demirel became the next President, in 1993 Tansu Çiller was elected as the next leader of True Path Party and became the first female prime minster in Turkish history. In 1991, a coalition government had been formed between Demirel and Erdal İnönü. But because İnönü left politics in 1993, Çiller continued to the coalition with Karayalçın. 

1993- Madımak

In sivas there was alleviate community living. There was pir sultan abdal festival. It was art festival. Aziz Nesin had remarks regarding religion taken in a bad way by religious groups. He was also translating book of salman rustu which was criticizing Islam. They were all staying in madmak hotel. Crowd started protesting after Friday prayers. People got angry due to combination of events and started fire on hotel. Many people had passed away during this event. After the events erdal inönü left the politics and murat karayalçın will become leader of social democratic populist party and Çiller continued to the coalition with Karayalçın.


1993- ISKI Scandal-> Ergun Göknel paravan şirket, which damaged the reputation of social democrats.

ISKI is related to water and savuage. ERGUN goknel was the manager of iski. They established shell company and entered tenders. So they took out money through the connections they have. Ergun Göknel's wife had disclosed the corruption of his husband because Göknel fell in love with his secretary. 


5 April Decisions  by Tansu Çiller in 1994 (documentary)



1994 Local Elections->Erdoğan won the local elections in İstanbul.
-In the 1994 elections, there were many internal divisions between the leftist parties. There were three leftist political parties during that time: RPP, which started again with Baykal, Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP), and Karayalçın's Social Democratic Populist Party. These three leftist parties all nominated different candidates for the Mayor of Istanbul. So, they could not manage to form strategic alliances, which significantly contributed to the victory of Erdoğan in istanbul. These three parties miscalculated "floating voters", who do not a have a certain ideological commitment. In metropolitan cities, thanks to its active women and youth movement, the Welfare Party used a great challenge to center left and center right parties. Ankara was also won by Melih Gökçek from Welfare Party. Also increasing role of islam in social life. Which is related to 1980 coup because it brought Turkish Islamic synthesis and moderate understanding of Islam became part of the mainstream. Also there was a urbanization flow from towns and when people move from towns to cities their conservatism became more stronger in this chaotic environment. So, they started to be more active within the religious oriented parties. Also headscarf problem in universities. They also got votes of leftist people because of the economic problems and it is also related to ideas of welfare party : just order : state being there to stop big business from eliminating small and medium size of bossiness and state being there for the people. They also present themselves as a modern party in their propogandas.  They suggested that which connects Kurds an Turkish people.

-In 1995, RPP of Baykal and Karayalçın's Social Democratic Populist Party come together under the leadership of Hikmet Çetin, a well reputated social democrat. 

-After the 1994 local elections, the Welfare Part introduced new things regarding municipalities. For instance, "white desk" was introduced. They also encouraged people's participation by creating people's assemblies. They wanted to make municipalities more accessible to people. They started to gain more and more sympathy as they effectively dealt with pollution and similar problems.

-Welfare Party successfully understood the dissatisfaction of voters such as nepotist capitalism.

-Welfare Party started to expand their electorate base. They appealed not only to rural conservative people, but also to urban people. The party beginner to have more modern outlook with local grassroots organization with women branches.


--------------------------------------------------------
1995 elections
Erbakan's Welfare Party became the first party with 22 percent of the votes. Therefore, the task of forming the government was given to Erbakan first. However, he could not manage to form his government. Because other parties stated that they were not going to make coalition with erbakans party.

-Then, a coalition government was formed between Tansu Çiller and Mesut Yılmaz, called "Anayol Government". However there was a huge bad blood between these two. So, eventually the coalition fell apart. After that, Erbakan and Çiller formed a coalition government. Erbakan promised Çiller that he would reject those demands for investigation in the parliament about alleged corruptions of Çiller, only on the condition that she forms a coalition with him. Thereby, Çiller and Erbakan formed the "Welfare Path" (Refahyol) coalition government in 1996.

Because first government had fallen and economy is going bad military also tolerated the coalition between çiller and Erbakan.

-"Welfare Path" coalition was an interesting coalition. There was a fear that Turkey would move away from secularism because an Islamist had become the prime minister the first time in the history of Turkey in 1996.

-Erbakan mentioned reorganizing Turkey towards the Islamic world, creation of a new Islamic security organization as an alternative to NATO. He also talked about using Dinar as Islamic currency and leaving lira. These eccentric statements created strong feelings. Erbakan and some members of his party made outrageous discourses regarding Turkish secularism. For example, Şükrü Karatepe's statements about 10 November.


-In 1997, Erbakan invited 51 sufi leaders to break fast together with them. Military was alarmed, they talked something about "Task Force Fest". The military started to monitor Islamist activities in Turkey. The task of this special unit was to curb down the influence of political Islam on education, state organs and economy. So, these areas were investigated by the military (olayların zamanları farklı control et)

-Especially the visit Erbakan made to Kaddafi in Libya led to huge discomfort in Turkey. Kaddafi told Erbakan about how horrible secularism in Turkey is. Erbakan just listened him after journalist published this incident people become angry.

-He had closer relationships with the Arab World.

-In November 1996, Susurluk Accident happened. A deputy chief of police, Hüseyin Kocadağ, and an ülkücü assassin, Çatlı, and a member of the parliament from True Path party, Sedat Bucak, was found together in the same car. The idea of "deep state" emerged as a popular controversial topic. In the car, there were some fake ids, weaponries found. Those weaponry was only enlisted in the inventory of the Special ops. After this accident, a report on the event was prepared. But it was not enough. Some people who are called to court to testify about the event said that they could not say anything because it is state secret. So, the event could not be enlightened. As a result, people started to protest this as they wanted a clean politics. A huge disobedience movement called "1 minute of darkness for permanent daylights" began in 1997. In February, the number of people protesting the government with pans and switching on and off the light. Number of protestors reached 30 million. Susurluk Accident was a turning point. Mum söndü oynuyolar gulu gulu dansı yapıyolar vb.

-The military continued to monitor the politics during that period. 161 military officers were expelled from the military.

-In Sincan, Ankara, the Jerusalem Night took place in 1997. Muncipality had organized this activity, and they invited the Iranian Ambassador to Turkey. That night, this ambassador made a powerful speech criticizing secularism. Few days after this speech was made, tanks started to roll in Sincan.




February 28 ,1997  post-modern coup

⭐️-On February 28, 1997, a National Security  Council meeting took place. The meeting 
was led by Süleyman Demirel as the President. The military wing of the council presented a long list of demands from the government of Erbakan. They said that the government had to fulfill these demands no matter what. This was an 18-article list, on the top which there was a demand for 8-year compulsory education that way military would be able to get rid of middle schools which will also eliminate middle grade imam hatip schools. There were also statement regarding reducing point percentage of imam hatip school graduates which will be able to make their acceptance to university more harder. and curbing down the influence of Islamist groups in the economy and the state apparatus. This had been done because there were concerns about imam-hatip graduates which can get into state institutions so that way they will infiltrate into state organization.  Also there was decisions on putting quran courses under the religious affairs and ending activities of sects. Restriction to Islamic capital.

-As a result of this meeting, the National Security Council defined Islamic fundamentalism as something more dangerous than terrorism 

-Erbakan initially resisted to sign this document of the National Security Council. He eventually signed it after about two weeks. 

-The military mobilized a huge section of the society (major business associations, media cartels, judiciary and university rectors) to go at Erbakan and political Islam. Later on, everyone forced Erbakan to resign and went at him. For instance, a Republican Prosecutor filed a court case for the closure of the Welfare Party. 161 officers were expelled form the army. A group called "front for secularism" was formed. A group of economic actors also favored that. There was a group called "gang of 5", which consisted of organizations such as TOBB, DISK, TISK and some trade unions. All these groups were putting pressure on Erbakan to resign. However, Erbakan resisted it, and he even survived a vote of confidence in May 1997.

-In June 1997, as a result of this excessive pressure on him, Erbakan resigned. According to the protocol, Tansu Çiller was the one who was going to replace him as the next prime minister. However, the President, Demirel, gave the duty of forming the new government to Mesut Yılmaz instead of Tansu Çiller. During that time, Demirel was on the side of the military. Demirel was fed up with her performance and thought it woud be best to give duty to Mesut yılmaz .

->Mesut Yılmaz approached Ecevit and Cindoruk to form a new coalition government.
Democratic Turkey Party of Cindoruk and Democratic Left Party of Ecevit joined Mesut Yılmaz (motherland party) to form a new coalition government called "Anasol". 

->Once Anasol came to power in 1997, they had to deal with the demands of the military about suppressing Islamist activities in Turkey. They also had to cope with the outcomes of the economic crisis (financial crisis in russia). In 1998 Mesut Yılmaz became the prime minister.

-Welfare Party was shutdown by the Constitutional Court in January 1998. The Virtue Party had been founded in 1997. The Virtue Party became the continuation of the Welfare Party after its closure. Erbakan was banned from the politics.


-The main priority of the military back then was to suppress Islamist movements. All of as a sudden, virtually all the Welfare Party Mayors became subject to an intensive investigation. The main target of these investigations was Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 1997 Erdoğan had recited a poem of Ziya Gökalp, and this became the legal base for his investigation. The court found Erdoğan guilty, saying that he was trying to incite religious hatred. As a result, he was sentenced to 10-months imprisonment. But Erdoğan made use of this by creating a successful perception of victimhood and gained huge sympathy from people.

-His sentence was reduced to 4-months, and Erdoğan went out of prison in 1999. However, at that point he was banned from politics. That ban would be gone after the 2002 elections.


-Mesut Yılmaz had a scandal with a businessman Korkmaz Yiğit. Interesting connections between mafia, the state and politics. Mesut Yılmaz could not survive the vote of confidence in the parliament. So, Ecevit became the prime minister in 1999. He formed a minority government as the care-taker for a while, and it was decided that there would be elections in 1999. 





-1999 Elections

-Before 1999 elections during Bulent Ecevit is prime minister, Öcalan was captured in Kenya and brought to Turkey. There was still death penalty when he was captured. But Americans said that there will be no death penalty for öcalan.

-Even though Ecevit had not been personally involved in the capture of Öcalan, he benefitted from that. His party became the first party in the 1999 with 23 percent of votes. The second party that benefitted a lot from this was the Nationalist Action Party, led by Devlet Bahçeli. Bahçeli was much more comfortable flirting with Islam. He understood that Islam was now a very important driving force. He introduces new changes in party. He got more flexible about party doctrine. Because he understood which way the wind is blowing (Islam). Also there were some changes regarding clothes of the party members in order to change typical outlook of the party members. Also they did not have big bad records such as corruptins. In 1999 elections, MHP received 19 percent of the votes, which was their record in their history. Virtue Party got 16 percents of votes which was a follow up part of welfare party.

-In 1999 elections, for the first time in its history, the RPP could not make it to the parliament, with 9 percent of votes. 

-A typical case of floating voter was observed in 1999 elections. People who do not have political orientation. MHP ye fayda sağladı.

-A coalition government was formed between DSP, ANAP and MHP, where Ecevit became the prime Minister.

-Ministry of health, ministiry of transportation , Minisitry of agriculture given to Bahçeli.

In July 1999, a deal was signed with IMF.

In August17 1999, earthquake exposed the weakness of the Turkish state. It also put a burden on economy. They did not get there on time. People got angry furious.


-In 2000, Ahmet Necdet Sezer became the next President after Demirel. The coalition government wanted someone they can work comfortably with also they can control. They looked for someone who does not have a powerful political background. They agreed on Ahmet Necdet Sezer. He was the former head of Constitutional Courts and was silent about his political preferences.

-Once Sezer became the president, he became increasingly popular. People respected him because he brought a different style of politics. However, from very early on, Sezer gave the signal that he was not the man who would give the seal of approval to everything brought to him by the government.

-2001 Crisis: February 2001 : operation white energy : there was an investigation going in enegery mn,stry. There were rumors that. In the ministry there were some individuals who fill their pocket with government contracts. Ministry of energy is under the control of motherland party. Normaly this inspection should have carried out by judiciary buy this was carried out by jandarma because both Sezer and military did not trust the politicians. Before the national security council meeting some beurocrats including sezer criticized members of the coalition saying they are undermining the process and acting like nothing happened. This turned into argument and Ecevit left the meeting before it had started. Major economic crisis was triggered.

-Ecevit invited Kemal Derviş to fix the economic issues in turkey including transparency of banking system. He was successful technocrat. He managed to put the economy on the track.

-EU Membership: Summit in Helsinki they started negotiation for turkey to become member of European Union.

---------------------------------------------

-Virtue Party, led by Recai Kutan. Erbakan was banned from politics but he was giving behind the scenes the orders to Kutan.

-After 1999 elections, Merve Kavakçı was elected from the Virtue Party. Headscarf issue during oath ceremony. This incident led to thoughts that this party also needed to be shut down as the Welfare Party. Eventually, the Constitutonal Court made a decision to shut down the Virtue party.

-⭐️⭐️⭐️While the military and judiciary was on the neck of the Virtue Party, there was also a division within the party. Abdullah Gül challenged Recai Kutan. "Renewers" , led by Gül, were trying to move away from the National View movement due to the outcomes of the 28 February and all those judicial and political bans. The alpha of this group was RTE but he was in backdoor because of his political ban. In the absense of Erdoğan, Gül was given the duty of carrying out the politics. They thought they may refer to the language of human rights, which they see also as decide to get the support from the outside world. Arınç and Şener were also in this group. This group has a common ground that they had to stay away from the language of political Islam -The other group was "Traditionalists".

-After the closure of the Virtue Party in 2001,  this group of "renewers" did not join the Felicity Party (saadet partisi) of the national view tradition. 


AK PARTİ
-After the closure of Fazilet, then these renewers founded AKP (Rte, Gül, arınç, şener). The party tried to position itself on the center-right spectrum. They left the national outlook agenda. They defined their democratic attitude as "conservative democrats". Some also called them Muslim democrats.

-They focused on democracy and freedoms. But they also believed that conservative elements of the society should not be neglected.

-They mentioned a more pro-western foreign policy vision. For instance, EU-focus was an important element in AKP's program in 2001. Also good relations with US. After 9-11, AKP stated that they were totally against terrorism, but they also underlined that this kind of terror activities cannot be associated with the Muslim World. Also they said this cannot be attrubiuted to islam so anyone can be terrorist we cannot attribute it to just islam.

-free market economy, neoliberal capitalism.
-catch-all, populist party.




2002 Early Elections

-Ismail Cem, the foreign minister of Ecevit' DSP, established the New Turkey Party in 2002. It could not enter the parliament due to 10 percent threshold.

-Genç Parti (Young Party) established by Cem Uzan in 2002. It was a center-right party. It could not enter the parliament due to the 10 percent threshold.

-10% threshold was decisive in the 2002 elections. Even though, AKP 35 percent of the votes, it gained the most seats in the parliament in its history because of the threshold. They got a number of seats a little less than 2/3 majority.




-⭐️⭐️⭐️AKP became the first party, receiving the 35 percent of the votes. People who were fed up with the political and economic instability want to give a chance to a new party. Additionally, economically, new Anatolian bourgeoisie, who was conservative but economically liberal, was an important driving force in the AKP's success in 2002 elections. Also after the 1980-coup, Turk-Islam synthesis had been brought more to the public sphere. However, the 28 February issues started huge struggle between the military and political Islam. So, AKP presented itself as a more moderate catch-all party, in order to show that they were different than older Islamic parties.
-In addition, the Copenhagen Criteria and EU reforms contributed to the electoral success of the AKP. The Copenhagen Criteria was based on democracy and human rights. In 2002-2004 period, based on the harmonization package, AKP passed 400-500 laws in the parliament in order to fit the Copenhagen criteria. They brought many freedoms regarding language, education, freedom of speech and freedom of press.

-side note: AKP also tried to be very cautious with the Military during that time.

-However, Reis had a jail sentence, and because that jail sentence was related to ideological and anarchic actions by reading poem, he was not allowed to be a member the parliament according to the Constitution. Also, according to the law, a prime minister could not have been appointed from outside the parliament. Hence, as Reis could not be ea member of the parliament, he could not be the prime minister either. Therefore, Abdullah Gül became the prime mister.
-->However, Baykal of RPP supported the changing of that provision in the constitution regarding ideological and anarchic sentences. So, the constitutional amendment was made, and then, in the 2003 By-Elections Erdoğan was elected to the parliament from Siirt. Then, Erdoğan became the prime minister. Gül became the foreign minister. Ali Babacan became the economy minister. He followed the austerity measures of Kemal Derviş. This led to economic growth and higher economic standards. AKP was lucky in that it was enjoying the benefits austerity measures taken by Kemal Derviş before. Also lira started to get better compared to other currencies. 

-So,they seemed like the saviors in that way. They were able to liberate the Turkish data from this high and chronic evaluation that it was living in.

-The welfare system has been now better  with the economy, the healthcare system, the education. Also, the mortgage system came along. Economic standards of people were becoming better.

-⭐️2004, candidate to EU. The EU accession process certainly gave momentum for the AKP to control the military through the EU harmonization package because this package military was not a political actor. The National Security Council' role was curbed through this EU harmonization package. National Security Council was now more civilized, and the secreteriat became civilian. The National Security Council's now became a totally advisory body.

-Better relations with the Middle East, for example with Esad in Syria. There were agreements related to gas oil. Also, with Iran.


sidenote: The first Gulf War had happened during the Özal era

-⭐️⭐️⭐️In 2003, the Iraq War took place..  
US decided to attack Iraq because of Saddam huseins' chemical weapon issues. They also wanted Turkey to work with them. The Ecevit government denied it, but in 2003 Erdoğan's government said that they could accept it. However, to realize such a move, Erdoğan had to pass it from the parliament. So, 1 March Motion came to the parliament. Although AKP nearly had 2/3 of the seats in the parliament, the 1 March Motion received only 267 "yes" votes. Many members of the AKP voted against this proposal. So, the motion could not pass from the parliament. So, this led to a break in the foreign policy between the Turks and Americans. Turkish soldiers were captured by American soldiers and they put hoods on Turkish soldiers.

-⭐️⭐️⭐️March 1 Motion



2002-2007 JDP Government

⭐️-Sabih Kanadoğlu was the Republican Prosecutor who mentioned for the first time the 367 issue for the Presidential elections in 2007. Kanadoğlu argued that 367, the 2/3 majority in the parliament, was not only the requirement to elect the President in the first round, but also a requirement for a quorum number for the meeting for the presidential elections. This was an interpretation and never applied before. So if there is votes less than 367 they will not be able to go second round. Ilk iki roundda 2/3 aranır 3. Roundda çoğunluğu alan alır. Prosedür

The cons court decided that the first round was not valid.

-> So, the RPP members protested the voting of presidential elections because they did not want Gül as the next President. So in the first round of the voting, 361 people attended the voting. 357 of them voted "yes" for Gül to be the president. However, after this first-round took place, the RPP took this issue to the Constutitonal Court, arguing that this voting is not valid based on Kanadoğlu's view.
-> At the night of this first round, the military published some documents in it website. The military was warning government because of their anti-laicist actions. (April 2007 E-Memorandum)
->This time AKP challenged the memorandum and the military. They said they would go for an early election, in order to show people's vote of confidence for their power. They considered the early elections as an opportunity for people to show their responses to the military and all other people who wanted to bring them down.

->As a result, AKP got 48 percent of the votes in the 2007 Elections. This time National Action Party (MHP) also made it to the parliament, and unlike the RPP members, the MHP attended the presidential voting. Thereby, in the third round, Abdullah Gül became the president in 2007. Even they did not vote for Abdullah gül, they entered to elections.

->Then AKP suggested that the President should be elected  by popular vote, with two terms maximum. the quorum number which turned out to be the major issue here was fixed simple majority for any kind of voting (1/3). And the elections in Turkey would be made every 4 years. 

-> The referendum ended  with a 69 percent "yes" vote. Abdullah Gül was the last president elected by the parliament. In 2014, RTE was elected
