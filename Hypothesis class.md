$h \in \mathcal{H}$
$h:$ is the specific model the algorithms learns from all possible outcomes $\mathcal{H}$.

The complexity of the hypothesis class can affect the learning algorithm's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. A hypothesis class that is too complex can lead to **overfitting**, where the model learns the training data too closely and fails to perform well on new, unseen data. Conversely, a hypothesis class that is too simple may lead to **underfitting**, where the model is not able to capture the underlying structure of the data well enough.
