## Problem 1
The returned value is 3 because we init the counter at 3 in a and at 7 in b, then we call a 2 times and b 1 time. This leads the counters for a to be 5 and for b to be 8. When we calculate the final diff exp we get 9-6 which results in 3.


## Problem 2A
```
let a = [
    let b = 17 in
        proc (x)  -(x, -(b, 11))] in (a 9)
```
**Evaluates to:** 3

## Problem 2B
```
[a] = 9
[b] = 17
```
