pass-value:
Shadow copies the passed variables.

pass-reference:
References are passed into functions. Therefore, functions can alter the variables.


The following build on reference passing:
call-by-name:
Call the function only when it is needed for the output.

call-by-need:
Builds on call-by-name + save function x parameter combos.
