### GPT Generated Explanation
In Scheme, `define-datatype` is a construct used to define new, custom datatypes. It's particularly useful for creating complex or recursive data structures. Hereâ€™s how it generally works:

1. **Naming the Datatype**: You start by giving your new datatype a name. This name is then used to refer to this kind of data throughout your program.
    
2. **Defining Constructors**: You define one or more constructors for your datatype. A constructor is a function that creates instances of your datatype. Each constructor can take different types of arguments, allowing for different ways to create instances of your datatype.
    
3. **Creating Recognizer Functions**: For each datatype, a recognizer (or predicate) function is automatically created. This function, typically named with a `?` at the end, is used to check if a given piece of data is of the defined datatype.
    
4. **Defining Selectors**: For each argument of a constructor, a selector function is often generated. These functions are used to extract these arguments from an instance of the datatype.

**Example:** 
```scheme
(define-datatype point point?
  (make-point
    (x-coordinate number?)
    (y-coordinate number?)
  )
)
```

I'm not sure if i understand the usage potential of define-datatype.
