[[Lecture 16 -- Scoping, Binding, Lexical Addressing.pdf]]


**Main Idea:**
We can index the values in the environment instead of using variable names. This can also be done in static scopeing.

## Static (Lexical) Scoping
- Usage of the scopes for matching variables.

## Dynamic Scoping
- No scope approach, just match everything linearly, disregard functions.

**Example:** 
```scheme
(define (func-a)
  (define x 10)
  (func-b))

(define (func-b)
  x)

(func-a)

```
**Answer:**
- **Under Static (Lexical) Scoping:** The Scheme interpreter with static scoping will result in an error when `(func-a)` is executed. This is because `x` is lexically scoped within `func-a`, and thus, it is not accessible within `func-b`. In lexical scoping, a variable is only accessible within the block where it is defined and its sub-blocks.
- **Under Dynamic Scoping:** If the Scheme interpreter uses dynamic scoping, executing `(func-a)` will return `10`. This is because, in dynamic scoping, the visibility of a variable is based on the call stack, not the lexical structure of the code. When `func-b` is called from `func-a`, `x` is present in the call chain, hence accessible in `func-b`.
