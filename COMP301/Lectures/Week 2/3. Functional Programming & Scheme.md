`(define square (lambda (x) (* x x))) -> ((define (square x) (* x x))`
**The value of a lambda expression is a procedure**

Heavy emphasis on the modularity of functional programming, capturing the common patters and so on.

* Formal parameter, argument
	n: formal parameter, 5: argument
## Substitution Model
A way to figure out what happens during evaluation, not really what happens in the computer
* **Compound procedure:** Evaluate the body of the procedure, with each parameter replaced (substituted) by the corresponding operand.
	`(average 5 (square 3)) `-> `(average 5 (* 3 3))`
* **Primitive Procedure:** Just do it
	`(/ (+ 5 9) 2)` -> `(/ 14 2)`

## Iterative vs Recursive approaches

| Aspect             | Iterative Approach                            | Recursive Approach                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Uses recursive calls **WITHOUT** pending operations.            | Uses recursive calls **WITH** pending operations.  |
| **Memory Usage**   | Typically uses constant space since the call stack doesn't grow.     | Uses more memory due to continious call stack growth |
| **Readability**    | Can be more straightforward for simple tasks. | Can be more intuitive for problems that have a naturally recursive structure (e.g., tree traversal). |
| **Efficiency**     | Might be more efficient for some problems due to reduced overhead. | Might have more overhead due to repeated function calls. Can be optimized using techniques like memoization. |
