## Practices While Following the Grammar
Some examples in the pdf, explanation about s-exp symbol replacement.
Didn't take notes for the examples since I think i understood most of them.
### How to follow the grammar, precisely?
- Write one procedure for each non-terminal. (The definitions on the left) The trick is to decompose procedures for each syntactic type.
- If the grammar doesn't help, try to generalize the problem.
