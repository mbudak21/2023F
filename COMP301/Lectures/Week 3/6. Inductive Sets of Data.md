## Inductive set definition
### Defining set S
#### Top Down Definition
**Definition 1.1.1:** A natural number n is in S if and only if
	1. $n=0$, or
	2. $n-3 \in S$.
```scheme
in-S?: N -> Bool
(define (in-S? n)
	(if (zero? n) #t
		(if (>= (- n 3) 0)
			(in-S? (- n 3))
		)
	)
)
```

#### Bottom Up Definition
**Definition 1.1.2:** Define the set $S$ to be the smallest set contained in $N$ and satisfying the following two properties:
1. $0 \in S$, and
2. if $n \in S$, then $n+3 \in S$

**Question:** Why is the "the smallest set" constraint needed?
**Anwer:** Because without this constraints, sets such as $S_2 = \set{0, 3, 6, 9, 10}$ are just as valid as $S_1 = \set{0, 3, 6, 9}$, since $S_2$ doesn't break any rules defined by the properties of the set.

#### Rules Of Inference Definition

Where,
- $0 \in S$ **Axiom:** The statement that is accepted True without proof.
- $n \in S$ **Hypothesis (Antecedent):** "if" part of the implication, which provides a condition. 
- $(n+3) \in S$ **Conclusion (Consequent):** "Then" part of the implication, which follows from the hypothesis. If $n \in S$ then, $(n+3) \in S$. 
- **Syntax:** The first line shows that the term under it is the Axiom, and the second line shows the Hypothesis and the Conclusion. 

### Defining a list of integers
#### Top Down Definition
A Scheme list is a list of integers if and only if,
1. It is an empty list, or
2. It is a pair whose car is an integer ans whose cdr is a list of integers.

#### Bottom Up Definition
1. $(.) \in \text{List-of-Int, and}$
2. $\text{if } n \in \text{Int and } ! \in \text{List-of-int}, \text{then } (n . 1) \in \text{List-of-int}$
