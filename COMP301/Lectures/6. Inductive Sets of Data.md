## Inductive set definition
### Defining set S
#### Top Down Definition - ends in base case
**Definition 1.1.1:** A natural number n is in S if and only if
	1. $n=0$, or
	2. $n-3 \in S$.
```scheme
in-S?: N -> Bool
(define (in-S? n)
	(if (zero? n) #t
		(if (>= (- n 3) 0)
			(in-S? (- n 3))
		)
	)
)
```

#### Bottom Up Definition - starts at base case
**Definition 1.1.2:** Define the set $S$ to be the smallest set contained in $N$ and satisfying the following two properties:
1. $0 \in S$, and
2. if $n \in S$, then $n+3 \in S$

**Question:** Why is the "the smallest set" constraint needed?
**Anwer:** Because without this constraints, sets such as $S_2 = \set{0, 3, 6, 9, 10}$ are just as valid as $S_1 = \set{0, 3, 6, 9}$, since $S_2$ doesn't break any rules defined by the properties of the set.

#### Rules Of Inference Definition

Where,
- $0 \in S$ **Axiom:** The statement that is accepted True without proof.
- $n \in S$ **Hypothesis (Antecedent):** "if" part of the implication, which provides a condition. 
- $(n+3) \in S$ **Conclusion (Consequent):** "Then" part of the implication, which follows from the hypothesis. If $n \in S$ then, $(n+3) \in S$. 
- **Syntax:** Rules of inference follows a syntax based on division. If there is no divisor, the term is an axiom. And if there is a divisor, the term at the top is the hypothesis, and the divisor is the conclusion. 

### Defining a list of integers
#### Top Down Definition
A Scheme list is a list of integers if and only if,
1. It is an empty list, or
2. It is a pair whose car is an integer ans whose cdr is a list of integers.

#### Bottom Up Definition
1. $(.) \in \text{List-of-Int, and}$
2. $\text{if } n \in \text{Int and } ! \in \text{List-of-int}, \text{then } (n . 1) \in \text{List-of-int}$

## Lambda Calculus - Grammar

### Defining S-list using grammar
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{S-list} &::= (\set{\text{S-exp}}^*) \\
\text{S-exp} &::= \text{Symbol } | \text{ S-list} 
\end{aligned}
$$

**Examples:**
	$\text{S-list} \rightarrow ()$
	$\text{S-exp} \rightarrow x$
	$\text{S-list} \rightarrow (x)$
	$\text{S-exp} \rightarrow (x)$
	$\text{S-list} \rightarrow \text{( (x) x (x) ( (x) x (x) )}
#### Syntax:
![[Pasted image 20231121163930.png]]
#### Kleene Notation:  
- **Star `{<exp>}*`**: Indicates that the expression `<exp>` can be repeated zero or more times.
 - **Plus `{<exp>}+`**: Indicates that the expression `<exp>` can be repeated one or more times.
 - **Separated List Plus `{<exp>}+{,}`**: Indicates a list of one or more `<exp>` separated by commas.
### Binary Tree
$$
\text{Bintree} ::= \text{Int } | \text{ (Symbol Bintree Bintree)}
$$
A binary tree in this example can either be an integer, or a symbol with two chil Binary trees.
The symbol isn't explicitly defined, however, we can imagine it to consist of arithmetic operations, so that our binary tree in the end shows a treelike structure of calculations.

#### Proove that full binary trees have odd number of nodes
$f(h): \text{returns the amount of nodes in a full binary tree of height } h$
**Proof by induction:**
Base Case: $f(1) = 1$, single node which is also the root of the tree
Inductive Step: $\text{if} f(h) \rightarrow f(h+1)$.
	$f(h+1) = f(h) + 2^h$ Since $f(h)$ is odd, odd + even = odd
### Lambda Expression

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{LcExp} &::= \text{Identifier}\\
&::= \text{(lambda (Identifier) LcExp)} \\
&::= \text{(LcExp LcExp)} 
\end{aligned}
$$
Where an identifier is any symbol other than "lambda".

**Examples:**
	$(\text{lambda } (x) \ x)$
	$(\text{lambda } (x) \ (\text{lambda } (y) \ z))$

## occurs-free?
If the given symbol affects the function from an outside scope, return **True**
