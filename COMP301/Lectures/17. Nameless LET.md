Use lexical depth to reference different variables instead of using their names.

Introduce `translation-of`: Translate the parsed program (which would be a syntax tree), and then pass it into the interpreter. 
What changed?
All the variables have been replaced with indexes which refer to locations in the new environment.
This eliminated the names of the variables and lets us refer to the environment directly, without using names or scanning the environment.
