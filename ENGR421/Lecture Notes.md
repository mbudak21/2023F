## Lec - 02
### Supervised learning
* #### Classification
	* Binary Classification: # of classes 2
		* Good, Bad customers in bank credit applications
		* Feature engineering: Which data is relevant?
	* Multiclass Classification: # of classes < 2
* #### Regression
	* Definiton $x = {(x_i, y_i)}^{N}_{i=1} y_i \sigma R$ 
	* Forecasting
	* Is there training in regresssion? I thought it was just a mathematial question

### Unsupervised Learning
* #### Clustering
	* Definition $x = {x_i}^{N}_{i=1}$
	* No labels
	* Fitting best rectangle
	* Risk asymmetry
	* Model selection
