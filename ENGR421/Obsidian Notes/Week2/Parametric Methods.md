Parametrics methods are used for problems in which we assume a specific distribution, most of the times we assume a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Parametric methods are usually faster than [[non-Parametric Methods]] because they assume distributions, however, if the chosen parametric form is a poor match for the true underlying data-generating process, it can result in model misspecification and poor generalization to new data.

#### Algorithms That Use Parametric Methods
- [[Density Estimation]]
- [[Parametric Regression]]


On the other hand, in [[non-Parametric Methods]] we don't assume any distribution. They are also called distribution-free methods.
