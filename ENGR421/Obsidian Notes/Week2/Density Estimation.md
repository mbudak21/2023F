Density estimation aims to find the underlying probability density function (PDF) from the observed data, assuming a distribution.

$$
x_i \sim p(x_i) \ \ \ \forall i \ \ \ p(\ .)=?
$$
For example, if we use the normal distribution as our function, we need to find two paramters $\sigma^2$ and $\mu$ .

The process of finding the assumed distributions is done with the following techniques: [[MLE]] and [[MAP]]
