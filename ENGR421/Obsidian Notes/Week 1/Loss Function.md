Typically refers to the cost associated with a single prediction; it quantifies how far off a prediction is from the actual result for an individual data point. The loss function is used during training to measure the individual penalty for inaccuracy. It's a function of the parameters of the model for a specific training instance.

**Examples:** 
Mean Squared Error ([[MSE]]) as a loss function, 
Mean Absolute Error ([[MAE]]),
