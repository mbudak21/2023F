A Supervized Learning algorithm, in which the $y_i$ values are real numbers. This difference leads us to use different [[Loss Function]]s .

**For example:** Mean Squared Error ([[MSE]]), Mean Absolute Error ([[MAE]]).

**Types:**
- [[Linear Regreesion]]
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Classification
- Naive Bayes Classifiers
- KNN (k nearest neighbors)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machine
