$X = \{ x_i \} ^N_{i=1}$   There is no $y_i$ label

Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. 

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself.

Unsupervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms: 
- [[Clustering]]
- [[Association]]
