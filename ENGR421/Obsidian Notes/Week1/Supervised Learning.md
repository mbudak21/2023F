$X = \{ (x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{N}$

$X:$ Training set
$x_i:$ i'th input
$y_i:$ i'th label\output
$N:$ number of data points

A machine learning technique where the algorithm is trained on **labeled data**. The input data will come with an output label. The machine is `supervised` with correct answers.

Supervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms, depending on the data wanted. The data is either [Classified], or `guessed` to a real number  [[Classification]] and [[Regression]]
